Hindi Wordplay Enhancement Using Sound Devices and LLMs
Project Description
This project explores the integration of sound devices (like rhyme, alliteration, assonance, and consonance) with large language models (LLMs) to improve the generation and analysis of Hindi wordplay. By leveraging custom strategies for managing syllables and phonetics, we aim to create more sophisticated and culturally resonant poetic structures in Hindi.

The methodology combines advanced LLM prompting techniques with Python-based analysis to evaluate and refine the quality of the generated outputs.

Features
LLM Integration: Uses ChatGPT for generating Hindi poems and wordplay.
Sound Device Analysis: Analyzes rhymes, alliteration, assonance, and consonance using Python.
Syllabic Management: Implements custom logic for syllable patterning and Sandhi combinations in Hindi.
Poetic Form Evaluation: Supports the identification of traditional Hindi poetic structures such as Doha and Chopai.
Tools and Technologies
ChatGPT: For generating Hindi wordplay.
Python: For analysis and evaluation, using the following key libraries:
string for text preprocessing.
collections for frequency and pattern analysis.
math for statistical and metric evaluations.
Current Status
This project is a work in progress. While the foundation for generating and analyzing Hindi wordplay has been established, ongoing development is focused on refining techniques for subtle features like slant rhymes, puns, and advanced phonetic analysis.

Known Issues
Certain functions from parameters.py may not always work as intended. These functions are crucial for analyzing syllables and implementing some advanced linguistic rules. Debugging and refinement of these functionalities are part of the current development roadmap.
Analysis of more nuanced poetic devices like consonance and assonance requires further improvement.
